title: About
---

I live in Claremont, California with my family and enjoy writing about bicycles, games, human centered-design, pop-culture, and technology.

If youâ€™d like to talk, you contact me by <a itemprop="email" href="mailto:shawn@medero.net" rel="me" class="u-email">email</a> or mention me on Mastodon (<a rel="me" href="https://friend.camp/@soypunk">@friend.camp@soypunk</a>). 

## Service

I am most proud of my community service efforts. I have to give a thanks to [Rotary's Interact][Interact] program at my high school which showed me how important it was to make difference in my community while helping me foster leadership skills.

Currently I'm Secretary for the Board of [Youth Theatre Works][ytw], an amazing non-profit that gives kids an inclusive space to be creative through the framework of theatrical productions. I also advise the Directors on technical matters from time to time. If there's one thing I would want anyone to do it would be to find a local arts program you care about in your community and find the best way you can support them.

I care deeply about equity in our schools and contribute time to the local school district's [Equity Advisory Council][EAC] as a Community Member/Parent. I am very thankful that our school district recognizes the need for this work and provides a space for collaborations between students, staff, and the larger local school community.

Previously I have served on other boards in several capacities including Vice Chair and Chair.

## Work

I've worked for startups, research labs, a large public university, and currently I'm the Chief Technology Officer for [Experience Based Learning Systems, LLC][EBLS]. My day-to-day work involves everything from writing software, identifying technology solutions, product strategy, hiring vendors, visual design system strategy, licensing agreements, and safeguarding my company's intellectual property. I have a [LinkedIn][] profile if you care to see the full work history.

Once upon a time I helped the [W3C's HTML Working Group][HTMLWG] manage & research issues with the HTML5 specification.

I have also [co-authored some research papers][GS], primarily on topics relating to user experience or search engines. Ages ago I wrote an article for A List Apart about [Paper Prototyping][] and over a decade later I still find it is useful method of gathering requirements -- depending on your stakeholders.
