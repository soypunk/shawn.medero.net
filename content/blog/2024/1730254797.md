> "(Open Ai's) Whisper has a major flaw: It is prone to making up chunks of text or even entire sentences, according to interviews with more than a dozen software engineers, developers and academic researchers. Those experts said some of the invented text — known in the industry as hallucinations — can include racial commentary, violent rhetoric and even imagined medical treatments."

1. We are expanding/restarting coal & nuclear power plants for this?
2. Are we seriously telling workforces that have seen huge staff reductions to work harder to correct the mistakes of gen-AI?
3. There are already people working on the NLP-based transcription issues related to medical-specific domain language...why did we ignore this research in favor of a tool (generative AI) that's purpose built to do a thing completely counter to what you would want in a transcription product?
