Every now and then I remind myself that the New York Times' idea of building a story is to contact someone in a related area and reprint exactly what they say without any other verification what-so-ever. For example [when the Times wanted to define the "lexicon of grunge" in the 90s they got in contact with a former Sub Pop records employee who gave them a bunch of made-up terms which the Times gleefully reprinted as fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grunge_speak).
