Alyssa Harad on Margaret Sullivan's (a former New York Times Public Editor) commentary concerning the New York Times' bizarre headline decisions in the current election cycle:

> I’m glad Sullivan wrote about this and I love her work but the fact that she’s posting on Substack to answer a question an NYT editor asked on X is very much part of the problem and it’s jarring that she can’t see it.
